  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great machine learning performance over a range of applications, but their operation is hard to interpret, even for experts. Various explanation algorithms have been proposed to address this issue, yet limited research effort has been reported concerning their user evaluation. In this paper, we report on an online between-group user study designed to evaluate the performance of "saliency maps" - a popular explanation algorithm for image classification applications of CNNs. Our results indicate that saliency maps produced by the LRP algorithm helped participants to learn about some specific image features the system is sensitive to. However, the maps seem to provide very limited help for participants to anticipate the network's output for new images. Drawing on our findings, we highlight implications for design and further research on explainable AL In particular, we argue the HCI and AI communities should look beyond instance-level explanations.},

abstract = { Deep neural networks (DNNs) routinely achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, but it can often be challenging for them to meet end-user needs in practice. This case study reports on the development of human-AI onboarding materials (i.e., training materials for users prior to using an AI) for a DNN-based medical AI Assistant to aid in the grading of prostate cancer. Specifically, we describe how the process of developing these materials changed the team’s understanding of end-user requirements, contributing to modifications in the development and assessment of the underlying machine learning model. Importantly, we discovered that onboarding materials served as a useful boundary object for cross-functional teams, uncovering a new way to assess the ML model and specify its end-user requirements. We also present evidence of the utility of the onboarding materials by describing how it affected user strategies and decision-making with AI in a study deployment to pathologists.},
