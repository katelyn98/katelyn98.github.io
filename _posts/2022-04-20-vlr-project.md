## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being built for and deployed in high-stakes domains such as detecting cancer from medical imagery <d-cite key="10.1145/3411763.3443435"></d-cite>, disaster relief efforts <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-09296"></d-cite>, and self-driving cars. However, these models are "black-boxes" and not interpretable to people that collaborate or interact with these models <d-cite key="10.1145/3377325.3377519"></d-cite>. Therefore, the interpretability and accuracy of these models are equally important to calibrate decision-makers reliance on AI and improve human-AI collaboration. 

With explainability and interpretability of AI becoming increasingly important, ML researchers designed a wide range of techniques from visualizing what the model has learned from an entire dataset, known as feature visualizations <d-cite key="olah2017feature"></d-cite>, to visualizing the pixels or region of an image that activated a particular class prediction, known as class activation maps <d-cite key="zhou2015cnnlocalization"></d-cite>. While these techniques are all derived quantitatively from the model, they are not always semantically meaningful to humans or even highlighting the correct region in the image despite a correct prediction, known as spurious correlations [**CITE**].

### Research Questions & Contributions

Therefore, our primary research questions are:
* [**RQ1**] How do current state-of-the-art object detection models compare to human attention? 
  - [**H1**] We hypothesize that current state-of-the-art object detection models do not nearly compare to human attention.
* [**RQ2**] What techniques will cause state-of-the-art object detection models to generate saliency maps that are similar to human eye-fixations while maintaining accuracy?
  - [**H2**] We hypothesize that some form of data augmentation that penalizes spurious patterns will result in more human-centered saliency maps.

Our primary contributions include: 
* We conduct a small empirical study to understand how seven current object detection models compare to human attention.
* We present a novel data augmentation technique called *Selective Inpainting* that can be used for augmenting images for image classification and object detection models
* We evaluate the impact that different data augmentation techniques have on saliency maps generated by Faster R-CNN.

## Related Works

Several explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been proposed as new ways to provide insights into the AI's prediction. Such techniques for computer vision tasks traditionally are presented as a heat map, highlighting the regions that most contributed to the model's prediction. However, several empirical studies in human-computer interaction literature have evaluated the interpretability of different techniques and their impact on decision-making. We present different saliency map techniques and perform empirical studies on different saliency map techniques.

### DNN Saliency Maps Compared to Human Attention

With novel interpretability techniques increasingly being developed, some researchers are taking a cognitive science approach to interpretability to understand how human attention and artificial attention compare.

### Towards DNNs with Human-Centered Saliency Maps

Recently, papers have proposed various routes to make saliency maps more human-centered and semantically meaningful to humans. For example, Boyd et al., propose a novel loss function that uses human annotations <d-cite key="cyborg"></d-cite>. This loss function is designed to penalize the model during training for generating saliency maps that are significantly different from the human saliency maps. The same authors just recently show that human annotations can improve the generalization of a DNN <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2105-03492"></d-cite>. For both of these studies, the authors had to collect ground truth annotations from human subjects in order to make this loss function which does not generalize well for other models or domains.

Instead of continuously having to collect human annotations, the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark has designed a challenge for saliency prediction models. This benchmark has yielded several techniques that can avoid the need for human subjects to obtain approximate ground truth human attention maps <d-cite key="kummererSaliencyBenchmarkingMade2018,salMetrics_Bylinskii,Judd_2012"></d-cite>. For example, the DeepGazeIIE saliency prediction model is currently the best performing saliency prediction technique compared to gold standard metrics <d-cite key="Linardos_2021_ICCV"></d-cite>. 

## Methods

Brief introduction about what we did

### Empirical Study [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IpOw3sfKtz_foSvRDy0nk7JyfdfDgZ23?usp=sharing)

We conducted an empirical study to gain an understanding of which state-of-the-art object detection models currently generate saliency maps similar to human attention. We evaluated and compared saliency maps generated by seven different object detection models available on PyTorch to human attention maps and predicted human eye-fixations. To obtain the human attention maps, we used the human attention maps for PASCAL2012 from the [ML-Interpretability-Evaluation-Benchmark](https://github.com/SinaMohseni/ML-Interpretability-Evaluation-Benchmark) <d-cite key="mohseni2020benchmark"></d-cite>. To obtain predicted human eye-fixations, we used the DeepGazeIIE saliency prediction model <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2105-12441"></d-cite>. The specific state-of-the-art object detection models we evaluated and compared to the human attention maps and predicted eye-fixations include YOLOV5 <d-cite key="glenn_jocher_2022_6222936"></d-cite>, Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/RenHG015"></d-cite>, SSD with a VGG backbone <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/LiuAESR15"></d-cite>, SSD with a MobileNet background <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-04381"></d-cite>, Mask R-CNN <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/HeGDG17"></d-cite>, RetinaNet <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1708-02002"></d-cite>, and DETR <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2005-12872"></d-cite>. 

**Experiment Details**

We generated a saliency map for every single image that had an associated human attention map (ground truth saliency) from the ML-Interpretability-Evaluation-Benchmark <d-cite key="mohseni2020benchmark"></d-cite> and for every image in the MIT1003 dataset <d-cite key="mit-saliency-benchmark"></d-cite>.

  <figcaption> Figure #: Visualization of evaluation pipeline for the empirical study. We generated the saliency map for an image of a dog using the SSD-VGG16 model as an example.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each image was resized to $$
512$$ x $$512
$$ 
before being evaluated on by the model. The saliency map for the object detection model is generated using the EigenCAM method (<d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2008-00299"></d-cite>) from the PyTorch library for CAM methods <d-cite key="jacobgilpytorchcam"></d-cite>. Once the saliency map from the object detection model is generated, the mean absolute error (MAE) is calculated between the generated saliency map and the human attention map. The MAE is also calculated between the generated saliency map and the predicted human eye-fixations (produced from the DeepGazeIIE model). 

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/mae_visualization.png" alt="visualization of how we calculate mean absolute error." width="100%"/>
  <figcaption> Figure #: Description.</figcaption>
</figure>

While the MAE to some extent can reveal how similar the saliency maps are, we also calculate intersection over union (IoU) between the top $$90\%$$ salient pixels of the generated saliency map and the top $$90\%$$ salient pixels from the human attention map/predicted human eye-fixation. Calculating the IoU will help reveal if the most salient region identify by the model and the humans align <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2107-09234"></d-cite>.

### Data Augmentations

Data augmentation for object detection is slightly more complex than data augmentation for image classification tasks because of the associated bounding boxes for each object <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-11172"></d-cite>. 

We designed three different data augmentation techniques: *selective erasing*, *selective inpainting*, and *non-trivial transformations*. Below, we define and provide examples of each of these data augmentations. 

**Selective Erasing** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xLAlGZHgBSIOXfWSuImUpdHBHngYmpmy?usp=sharing)



The goal of selective erasing is to get rid of potential spurious patterns, patterns that the model has learned to associate with a label even though it does not represent that label [*CITATION*]. In order to augment images using selective erasing, we send the image through Faster R-CNN and use EigenCAM to generate the saliency map from layer 4 in the backbone. We then send the image through the DeepGazeIIE model to generated the predicted eye-fixations map. We calculate the intersection over union (IoU) between the two saliency maps. If the IoU is below 0.1, meaning the two saliency maps are significantly different from one another, then we erase the top 2.5% salient pixels identified from the Faster R-CNN saliency map from the original image. An example of this process and the outcomes from each step are shown in Figure 1. We chose the top 2.5% because these pixels would most likely make up the core region of a potentially spurious region. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/selective_augment.png" alt="dataset augmentations" width="100%"/>
<figcaption>Figure 1: Example of how the selective erasing and selective inpainting augmentation techniques work. If the IoU between the Faster R-CNN saliency map and DeepGaze saliency map is less than 0.1 than erase the top 2.5% salient pixels from the original image. Using an untrained neural network, inpaint the pixels that were erased. In this image, pixels along the border were most salient so they were erased and then inpainted. </figcaption>
</figure>


**Selective Inpainting**
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oK3MZeY8cpVhd5jH-7C-yMj4N0igMmvt?usp=sharing)


The selective inpainting augmentation process follows the same steps as selective erasing and then inpaints the erased image. To inpaint the top 2.5% salient pixels as denoted by Faster R-CNN, we send the selective erased image and mask into an untrained neural network and optimize on learning the pixels that minimize the chosen loss function. This idea is presented in the Deep Image Prior Paper <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-10925"></d-cite>. We used $4001$ iterations with an untrained ResNet to inpaint the erased regions in each image. 


**Non-trivial Transformations** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z158yrypCbLhpOGYCzsYJGXJIlhrDTW7/view?usp=sharing)


Data augmentation can improve performance and outcomes of models as it can add new and different examples to the training dataset. If the dataset in a model can be more rich and sufficient with the augmentation techniques, the model can perform better. To improve the model generalization, we apply the following augmentation techniques seen in Figure 2. In our experiment, we do experiments of bounding box geometric augmentation, color augmentation, and geometric augmentation.

We identify a top preforming model in terms of MAE and IoU and use that model in our main experiment. We selected the top performing model for our main experiment to focus on the impact of the augmentations for one model instead of comparing the impact of augmentations across different models. Since Faseter R-CNN performed the best for MAE on PASCALVOC2012, we use this model in our main experiment. We wanted to use SSD-VGG16 as well, but we had different modifying the architecture to fine-tune on PASCALVOC2012, so we did not use this model in our main experiment.

## Limitations

**Access to Powerful Computers**

We did this entire project on Google Colab which limited us in terms of the GPU that we could use and the amount of memory we had. We were able to use Colab Pro, but even then the GPUs we were using were limited to 16GB which forced us to use smaller batch sizes than normal. 

**Pre-trained models trained on COCO**

The pre-trained models we used in our empirical study were from the PyTorch torchvision library <d-cite key="pytorchtorchvision"></d-cite>, but our dataset that we were using was PASCALVOC2012. Evaluating the pre-trained models on a different dataset could have impacted how we interpret our results. Unfortunately we realized this too late in the project to switch to COCO. 

## Future Work & Conclusion

Future work should explore these questions for image classification instead of object detection. Other future works could try instead of doing augmentations could create a novel function that incorporates the MAE between the saliency map generated from the model and the saliency map of the DeepGazeIIE or similar saliency prediction model into the loss function to basically train the model to focus on semantically meaningful regions of the image with ground truth labels.

Future work should tune the threshold for selective erasing/inpainting to optimize on amount of pixels that are deleted/inpainted.

<!-- ## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look well in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. -->
