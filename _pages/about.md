I am a first year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). I am broadly interested in human-AI collaboration, computer vision, and high-stakes decision making. At the intersection of these interests, I am exploring how we can design eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques and complementary user interfaces to address stakeholders' needs in high-stakes decision making situations.  

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities.
