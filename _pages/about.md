I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). I am on the job market this year for academic and industry positions in the space of responsible, trustworthy, and human-centered AI. My research bridges technical machine learning approaches 🤖 and human-centered methods 👩🏻‍💼 to design and evaluate explainable AI (XAI) systems that enhance human-AI collaborations in critical decision-making contexts, such as healthcare and wildlife conservation. In recognition of my work at the intersection of AI and health, I was awarded a Digital Health Innovations Fellowship from the Center for Machine Learning and Health at Carnegie Mellon University. My research has also been funded by the NIH and the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Throughout my Ph.D., I've been fortunate to complete multiple research internships at Microsoft Research and IBM Research. I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities.
