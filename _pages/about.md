I am a third year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). My research focuses on improving **human-AI collaboration** (👩🏻‍💼 + 🤖) with **Generative AI** by investigating **reliance on AI** and the impact of eXplainable AI (**XAI**) visualizations and interactions. My research has focused on **language models** explaining **image classifications** in high-stakes decision-making domains such as building damage assessment 🛰, wildlife conservation 🦜, and medical imaging 🩻. I am also interested in exploring Generative AI in low-stakes domains. My research has been funded by the NIH and the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a co-organizer for a workshop at NeurIPS 2023 on [Computational Sustainability: Promises and Pitfalls from Theory to Deployment](https://www.compsust.net/compsust-2023/). 

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities. I also served as a co-organizer for the 2020 and 2022 [Computational Sustainability Doctoral Consortium](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2020/).
