I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). I am broadly interested in human-AI collaboration, computer vision, and high-stakes decision making. At the intersection of these interests, I am exploring how we can design eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques and complementary user interfaces to address stakeholders' needs in high-stakes decision making situations.  

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
