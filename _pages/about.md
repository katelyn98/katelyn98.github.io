I am a second year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). I am interested in human-AI collaboration (👩🏻‍💼 + 🤖), eXplainable AI (XAI), and computer vision. At the intersection of these interests, I am exploring how we can improve human-AI collaboration through human-centered approaches in high-stakes domains such as building damage assessment 🛰 and wildlife conservation 🦜. I am also interested in exploring human-centered approaches to improve low-stakes human-AI collaboration. I am a co-organizer for the 2023 [Computational Sustainability Doctoral Consortium](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2020/). 

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities. I also served as a co-organizer for the 2020 and 2022 [Computational Sustainability Doctoral Consortium](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2020/).
