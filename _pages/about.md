I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). My research focuses on enhancing and augmenting **human-AI collaboration** (👩🏻‍💼 + 🤖). My recent research has focused on interactions with **Vision-Language Models** in wildlife conservation and medical imaging as well as **Bayesian Networks** for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension risk outcome. My research has been funded by the NIH, the Center for Machine Learning and Health, and the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certificate in sustainability. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities. I also served as a co-organizer for the 2020, 2022, and 2023 [Computational Sustainability Workshop](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2023/).
