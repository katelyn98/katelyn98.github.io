I am a first year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Perer](https://perer.org/). I am broadly interested in human-AI collaboration, eXplainable AI (XAI), and computer vision. At the intersection of these interests, I am exploring how we can design XAI techniques and complementary user interfaces to address stakeholders' needs a variety of decision making scenarios. I also serve as a co-organizer for the 2022 [Computational Sustainability Doctoral Consortium](http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2020/).

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in *computer science* and a certificate in *sustainability*. In undergrad, I focused on the application and limitations of computer vision models as well as the distribution of smart mobility resources within cities.
