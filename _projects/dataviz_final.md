## Project Description

We are exploring different interactions and interfaces for non-expert users to better understand (1) when deep learning models make classifications based on shape or texture, (2) the limitations of deep learning models used for image classification tasks , and (3) compare and contrast XAI techniques to regions that non-experts think are important for the classification of a given image. 

### Shape Bias

To learn more about shape bias, you can read this paper from ICLR 2019: [ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bygh9j09KX). 


## Working Demo 

Not all features are fully implemented yet (*still under construction - project due November 30th*).
