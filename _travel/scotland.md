# Discovering our Ancestors

For my dad's 74th birthday, I gifted my dad a trip to Scotland. This was a really special gift because my dad has only been out of the country when he was a young adult in the Marine Corp. 

I knew that I was part Scottish since I was in grade school, but I never knew the details about my ancestors. I quickly became involved in my dad's ancestrial research once I started my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon. One thing I learned is that it is really easy to believe anything that crowdsourced ancestry websites show (e.g., being related to a famous person). As a researcher, I was reluctant to believe such claims from these sites because they lacked validity and had no proof (i.e., documentation, records). Going to Scotland to find the physical records was our solution. So on August 14th, we got on a plane in Pittsburgh to fly to Scotland! 

## Road Trip of a Lifetime :airplane: :blue_car: :ship:

The months leading up to August 14th, I chatted with my dad weekly to figure exactly what he wanted to see in Scotland and where he wanted to go to gather information about our ancestors. Places such as Isle of Lewis, Dornoch, and Dunfermline were top of the itinerary. Isle of Lewis is supposedly where the original line of the Morrison clan began. Dornoch is the closest town to Andrew Carnegie's castle and Dunfermline is where Margaret Morrison raised Andrew Carnegie with her husband William Carnegie. 

With these details, I began putting together a two-week itinerary to tour around Scotland. Starting in Edinburgh then on to Dunfermline, we covered a lot of ground in terms of research. We then took a few days off to explore St. Andrews along the North Sea and the Highlands where we saw Loch Ness, Urquhart Castle, and Inverness. After that, we headed up to Dornoch where we visited Andrew's Castle, Skibo, for a private tour with the archivist. We continued our research on Isle of Lewis, where the original line of the Morrison clan supposedely began. Then the last few days of the trip we enjoyed some tourism on the Isle of Skye and Edinburgh.

### Driving in Scotland

Driving in Scotland, especially the Highlands, is an entire adventure in itself. Not only are you driving the on the other side of the road (which is very challenging), but many of the "highways" in the Highlands are *very very narrow*. The highways in the Highlands and Western Isles look like they are one-way, but don't be tricked. They are two-way roads with pull-off zones so that oncoming vehicles can safely pass. :flushed: This made driving very very stressful.

## Dunfermline

## Skibo Castle

We were very lucky to be able to connect with the archivist at Skibo Castle for a private tour. We learned all about Andrew and Louise during our time at Skibo including their hobbies, passions, and values. With Andrew's belief that every woman deserves to be educated, Carnegie Mellon is now one of the world's most prestigious institutions with a balanced and diverse student body.

On the other side of the flag is the Great Britain flag. This is to represent Andrew's ties to America and Great Britain.
