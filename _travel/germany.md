### Day hike at Via KÃ¶nigsweg to Schachen
8.8 miles with 2700 feet elevation gain. This took us around 6 hours to complete (including time to stop for lunch and take pictures).

### Hike around the beautiful Eibsee Lake
Just a little more than 5 miles walking by Eibsee Lake with a little under 1000 feet in elevation gain. This trail is a beuatiful mix of lake views and forest. Plenty of opportunities to swim, so bring an extra pair of socks and a swimsuit!

<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
