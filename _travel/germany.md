# Garmisch-Partenkirchen

We spent two nights and three days in Garmisch, which personally, I think was not enough of time. The area is full of so many amazing hikes, waterfalls, and gorges --- three days is just not enough of time. The best time to travel to this area for hiking is between May and September. The area has great skiing and winter sports activities as well if you prefer to travel during the winter months! Check out the exact trails we took below.

### Day hike at Via KÃ¶nigsweg to Schachen
8.8 miles with 2700 feet elevation gain. This took us around 6 hours to complete (including time to stop for lunch and take pictures). We did this hike in the beginning of May and there was still several feet of snow on the trail near the top. Just be aware of avalanches and take proper snow shoes if there will be snow. The elevation gain is pretty strenuous and this is no hike for the light-hearted. There are no technical parts of the trail (no climgbing, scrambling, or bouldering) and the views are totally worth it!

### Hike around the beautiful Eibsee Lake
Just a little more than 5 miles walking by Eibsee Lake with a little under 1000 feet in elevation gain. This trail is a beuatiful mix of lake views and forest. For a good portion of the trail, you are walking through mainly forests and will not have any view of the lake until you start walking alongside the lake itself. Plenty of opportunities to swim once you arrive to the lakefront, so bring an extra pair of socks and a swimsuit! Definitely plan to eat your lunch while on this hike.

### Hike to a beautiful Gorge
For our last hike, we attempted to see one of the gorges in the area. However, the gorge was closed for some reason (perhaps because of spring snowmelt). The first half of this hike shows you how to get to the gorge, but we eventually had to turn back towards our starting location on another route since we could not proceed. Still a beautiful hike with amazing views.
